Let's get straight back to work. 
You were about to fix this code 
to meet PEP8 Data Engineering 
Standards (snake_case for variables, ALL_CAPS for constants).

FileLoc = "/data/users.csv"
MaxLimit = 100
n = "John Doe"
 '''


file_location = "/data/users.csv"  # snake_case for variables
MAX_LIMIT = 100                    # ALL_CAPS for constants
user_name = "John Doe"             # Descriptive snake_case


"""
Why this matters: When you see FileLocation in a Python script, 
you assume it's a blueprint (Class).
When you see file_location, you know it's data (Variable).
