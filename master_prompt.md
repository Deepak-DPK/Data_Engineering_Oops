**PROMPT:**

```
Restructure this README file following these guidelines:

1. STRUCTURE:
   - Start with clear Learning Objectives (🎯)      
   - Core Concepts section with concise explanations
   - Use tables for organized information presentation
   - Include Quick Reference section for common patterns

2. CONTENT FOCUS:
   - NO full code duplication (code belongs in .py files)
   - Focus on WHAT each file teaches, not HOW (no full code blocks)
   - Explain concepts, not implementations
   - Brief file descriptions with purpose only

3. FILE REFERENCES:
   - List all practice files with 1-line descriptions
   - Link to files: [filename.py](filename.py)
   - Group files by topic/category

4. REAL-WORLD CONTEXT:
   - Include "Why This Matters" section for Data Engineering applications
   - Show practical use cases in table format
   - Connect concepts to actual pipeline scenarios

5. FORMATTING:
   - Use emojis for section headers (📚 🎯 💡 🔑 📂)
   - Tables for comparisons and references
   - Clear hierarchy with proper markdown headers
   - Keep it scannable and concise

6. AVOID:
   - Duplicating full code examples from .py files
   - Long code blocks (max 3-5 lines for syntax reference only)
   - Redundant explanations
   - Over-detailed walkthroughs

7. INCLUDE:
   - Learning objectives at top
   - Concept summary tables
   - File inventory with purposes
   - Real-world applications table
   - Quick reference snippets (syntax only)
```
